                My name is Bailey, and I am incoming software developer at Netflix. 
                I have a wide variety of interests, from web dev, to embedded systems, to robotics.
                I am excited to join such a talented team, and I made this page to share my experience and journey along the way.
            </p>
            <p>
                I primarily focus on JavaScript, Python, and C++. I have recently started dabbling in Rust and Go as well.
