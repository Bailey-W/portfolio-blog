## Introduction
Hello! I'm Bailey, a computer science student from Ohio with a passion for the industry.
I'm excited to be writing this post and sharing my journey so far with the world.
I plan on using this platform as a place to share my recent projects, tutorials,
and interesting news related to software development.
